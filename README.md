# ForestBlue Xcode

 Port of [olkinn's](https://github.com/olkinn) [ForestBlue](https://github.com/olkinn/forest-blue-iTerm) theme from [ITerm2](https://iterm2.com) for Xcode with a few tweaks

Note : The theme uses a few nonstandard fonts (namely MonoLisa and Inconsolata) so either replace them yourself or download them. Inconsolata is free however MonoLisa isnt (id recommend smth like SF Mono, Monoid or Fira Mono as theyre all great options however you'll need to mess with some settings to get them to look right)

Links:   
 [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev).   
 [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?subset=latin-ext&preview.text=İŞĞÜÖÇ%20ışğüöç&preview.text_type=custom).
