# ForestBlue Xcode

 Port of [olkinn's](https://github.com/olkinn) [ForestBlue](https://github.com/olkinn/forest-blue-iTerm) theme from [ITerm2](https://iterm2.com) for Xcode with a few tweaks

Note : The theme uses a few nonstandard fonts (namely MonoLisa and Helvetica Neue) so either replace them yourself or download them. Helvetica Neue is free for personal use and Mono Lisa is paid so id recommend smth like SF Mono, Monoid or Fira Mono to replace MonoLisa and SF Pro Inter, Roboto, regular Helvetica or Cantarell to replace Helvetica Neue as they're all great options however you'll need to mess with some settings to get them to look right)
